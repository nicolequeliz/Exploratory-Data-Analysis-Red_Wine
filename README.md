# Exploratory Data Analysis: Red Wine
In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. 
For this project, you will conduct your own exploratory dat analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice. 
The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-conscoiusness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.
